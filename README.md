Jasper Reports Shell documentation


## Motivation

I was missing the ability to contribute into the original repository for JRSH, so I made this temporary repository for the documentation of the tool.

## Installation

Please use FreeMind or MindNode mindmapping software for being able to read the mindmaps. So far PDF version is always available too.
